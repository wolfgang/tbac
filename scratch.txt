Next:

[X] Tokenize variable name
[X] Tokenize LET
[X] Parse LET
[X] Parse variable in additon to number in if expressions
[X] PRINT 10, 20, "HELLO"
[X] PRINT A, 10, B
[ ] LET A = B
[ ] Handle real expressions like 1+2, a+c 1*b
[ ] Implement GOTO

Add type alias for Box<dyn Node>

Could use the is_node and as_node functionality to get rid of Node::eval; code gen becomes
a case statement over node type + downcast (like in the DAS screencast)

LiteralNode instead of NumberNode + VarNode?





Things left to do:

X Error handling at high-level (compiler)

X Newlines?

Support expressions

Support variables

Support goto/gosub (?) -> break statement
